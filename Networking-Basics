What is an IP address ?

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other over the internet or local networks.

IPv4: 192.168.1.1
IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

What is subnetting?

Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). It helps improve network performance and security.

Splitting 192.168.1.0/24 into two subnets:
192.168.1.0/25 (hosts 1-126)
192.168.1.128/25 (hosts 129-254)

What is CIDR?

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing that replaces the old class-based system. It uses a prefix (e.g., /24) to specify the network portion of an IP address.
Example:
192.168.1.0/24 means the first 24 bits are the network part, leaving 8 bits for host addresses.

What is a Port?
	
A port is a logical endpoint for communication in networking, used to identify specific processes or services on a device.
Example:
HTTP uses port 80

To get IP address: ip -4 addr show eth0 | grep -oP '(?<=inet\s)\d+(\.\d+){3}'

To connect WSL Ubuntu specific version: wsl -d Ubuntu-Copy
