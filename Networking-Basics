What is an IP address ?

**Answer:**
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other over the internet or local networks.

**Example:**
IPv4: 192.168.1.1
IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

What is subnetting?

**Answer:**
Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). It helps improve network performance and security.

**Example:**
Splitting 192.168.1.0/24 into two subnets:
192.168.1.0/25 (hosts 1-126)
192.168.1.128/25 (hosts 129-254)

What is CIDR?

	Answer:
	An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other over the internet or local networks.
	Example:
	IPv4: 192.168.1.1
	IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

What is CIDR?
	Answer:
	CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing that replaces the old class-based system. It uses a prefix (e.g., /24) to specify the network portion of an IP address.
	Example:
	192.168.1.0/24 means the first 24 bits are the network part, leaving 8 bits for host addresses.

What is a Port?
	Answer:
	A port is a logical endpoint for communication in networking, used to identify specific processes or services on a device.
	Example:
	HTTP uses port 80

	What is an IP address?
		Answer:
		An IP address is like a home address for your computer or phone on a network. It helps devices find and talk to each other.
		Example:
		IPv4: 192.168.1.1 (like a street address)
		IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:... (used for newer devices)

	What is subnetting?
		Answer:
		Subnetting is like splitting a big group into smaller teams so things are easier to manage. It helps organize devices and keeps the network running smoothly.
		Example:
		If you have 100 devices, you can split them into two groups of 50 each.

	What is CIDR?
		Answer:
		CIDR is a way to write IP addresses that shows how many devices can be in a group. It makes it easier to organize and share addresses.
		Example:
		192.168.1.0/24 means you can have up to 256 devices in that group.

	What is a Port?
		Answer:
		A port is like a door on your computer that lets certain types of information in and out. Different doors are used for different things.
		Example:
		Web pages use port 80
		Secure web pages use port 443
